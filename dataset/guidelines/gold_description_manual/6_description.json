    "non-altering": "A word or a multi-word phrase that marks an action done on a sample that either does not induce any transformation of the sample or does not belong to any of the above classes. \"The pellets were [placed] in a sealed alumina crucible\", \"the reaction vessel was [wrapped] with aluminum foil\", \"the sample was [sealed] in a tube\", \"the gel was [transferred] to an oven\".",
    "starting": "A word or a multi-word phrase that marks the beginning of a synthesis procedure. Specically, this often indicates which materials will be produced. For example: \"PMNPT was [synthesized] by the columbite precursor method\", \"solidstate synthesis was [used to prepare] the target material\", \"the powder was [obtained] after the aforementioned procedure\".",
    "mixing": "A word or a multi-word phrase that marks the combination of different materials (in a solid or liquid phase) to form one substance or mass. For example: \"precursors were weighted and [ball-milled]\", \"precursors were [mixed] in appropriate amounts\", \"Sb2O3 is [added] to the solution\", \"the solution was [neutralized]\", \"the mixture was [stabilized] by the addition of sodium citrate\".",
    "heating": "A word or a multi-word phrase that marks increasing or maintaining high temperature for the purpose of obtaining a specific sample phase or promoting a reaction rather than drying a sample. For example: \"the powder sample was [annealed] to obtain a crystalline phase\", \"the mixture was subjected to [heating] at 240 C for 24 h\".",
    "reaction": "A word or a multi-word phrase that marks a transformation without any external action. For example: \"the sample was [left to react] for 6 h\", \"the temperature was [kept] at 1000 K\", \"the solution was [maintained] at 200 K for 12 h\".\n",
    "shaping": "A word or a multi-word phrase that marks the compression of powder or forming the sample to a specific shape. For example: \"the powder was [pressed] into circular pellets\", \"the powder was then [pelletized] with a uniaxial press\".",
    "purification": "A word or a multi-word phrase that marks the separation of the sample phases. This also includes drying of a material. For example: \"samples were [exfoliated] from substrates\", \"the liquid was discarded and the remaining product was [filtered off] and [washed] several times with distilled water\", \"the precursors were [heated] in order to remove the moisture\", \"the precipitate was [collected] by washing the solution in distilled water\".",
    "cooling": "A word or a multi-word phrase that marks rapid, regular, or slow cooling of a sample. For example: \"the product was [cooled] down to room temperature in the furnace\", \"the sample was [quenched] rapidly in the solid CO2\", \"the product was [left to cool] down to room temperature\"."
