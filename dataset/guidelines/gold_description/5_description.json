    "coulombicefficiency": "Based on the guideline, the relation extraction label \"coulombicefficiency\" is not explicitly defined. However, based on the context and the relations mentioned in the paper, it can be inferred that \"coulombic efficiency\" refers to the ratio of the amount of electric charge that is actually used in a chemical reaction to the total amount of electric charge that is available.\n\nExample description: \"The coulombic efficiency of a battery material is 90%, meaning that 90% of the electric charge that is available is actually used in the chemical reaction, while the remaining 10% is lost as heat or other forms of energy.\"\n\nNote that this definition is inferred based on the context and may not be the exact definition used in the paper.",
    "voltage": "The voltage relation refers to the measurement of the potential difference between two points in a material, typically in the context of battery materials, and is represented as a triplet (entity1, voltage, entity2).```\n\nThis definition is inferred from the context of the guideline, which mentions that the relation extraction task targets battery materials and identifies five relations, including voltage. The example sentence provided in the guideline also supports this definition, as it mentions \"high electrical conductivity of 30.7 S cm 1\" which implies a measurement of voltage.",
    "capacity": "The relation extraction label \"capacity\" refers to the amount of electric charge that can be stored or delivered by a material, typically measured in units of milliampere-hours (mAh) or ampere-hours (Ah). For example, in the sentence \"Tin phosphide (Sn4P3) has been a promising anode material for SIBs owing to its theoretical capacity of 1132 mA h g-1 and high electrical conductivity of 30.7 S cm-1\", the capacity of the material Tin phosphide is mentioned as 1132 mA h g-1.",
    "energy": "The \"energy\" relation refers to the energy-related properties or values of the materials or compositions, such as energy density, energy storage capacity, or energy conversion efficiency.```\n\nFor example, in the sentence: \"Tin phosphide (Sn4P3) has been a promising anode material for SIBs owing to its theoretical capacity of 1132 mA h g-1 and high electrical conductivity of 30.7 S cm-1\", the \"energy\" relation might refer to the theoretical capacity of 1132 mA h g-1, which is an energy-related property of the material.",
    "conductivity": "The relation \"conductivity\" refers to the ability of a material to conduct electricity, typically measured in units of Siemens per centimeter (S/cm). It is a property of a material that describes how easily it allows electric current to flow through it. For example, in the sentence \"Tin phosphide (Sn4P3) has been a promising anode material for SIBs owing to its theoretical capacity of 1132 mA h g-1 and high electrical conductivity of 30.7 S cm-1\", the relation \"conductivity\" is extracted as a property of the material \"Tin phosphide (Sn4P3)\" with a value of 30.7 S cm-1.```"
