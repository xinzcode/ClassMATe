    "material": "A material is a substance, element, or class of materials that is mentioned as a participant in a fuel cell experiment. It can be specified by a particular material composition formula or by a general class of materials such as oxides or hydrocarbons. Adjectives relative to the material are included in the annotation only if they are necessary to distinguish between different materials that may have the same composition.",
    "device": "The type DEVICE is used to mark mentions of the device used in the fuel cell experiment. We do not include any modifiers such as adjectives in the annotation span. For example, \"The corresponding SOFC with Pt/SmNiO3/Pt geometry demonstrated dramatic power output of 225 mW cm-2 at 500\u00b0C.\" [PMC5793538]",
    "experiment": "An experiment is a relevant solid oxide fuel cell experiment that explicitly mentions at least one of the following elements: the material composition of the fuel cell, the condition of operation of the fuel cell, the type of fuel cell, or a chemico-physical property of the whole fuel cell.",
    "value": "The type VALUE is used to annotate numerical values and their respective units, including comparative specifiers like \"more than\", \"between\", etc. For example, \"The single-phase SP parent material Ba0.5Sr0.5(Co0.8Fe0.2)O3\u2212\u03b4 itself is an MIEC and effective SOFC cathode that displays a range of ASR values from 0.03 to 10 \u03a9\u00b7cm2 at 650 \u00b0C.\"",
    "support_material": "The support_material relation connects the frame-evoking element and the material that makes up the support of the cell.",
    "experiment_evoking_word": "An \"experiment-evoking word\" is a word that introduces an experiment involving a fuel cell, such as \"test\", \"evaluate\", \"measure\", or \"generate\". These words typically indicate that an experiment is being described or conducted, and are used to connect the participants of the experiment to the frame-evoking element.",
    "fuel_used": "The \"fuel_used\" relation connects the frame-evoking element and the chemical composition or the class of a fuel or the oxidant species (indicated as a material).",
    "power_density": "The power density of a device is the maximum power output per unit area, typically measured in units of watts per square centimeter (W/cm\u00b2). For example, \"The corresponding SOFC with Pt/SmNiO3/Pt geometry demonstrated dramatic power output of 225 mW cm-2 at 500\u00b0C.\"",
    "current_density": "The relation \"current_density\" connects the frame-evoking element with the value of the current density of that experimental setup.",
    "working_temperature": "The working_temperature is the value of the temperature at which the cell is operated or at which a certain experiment has been performed.",
    "time_of_operation": "The definition of \"time_of_operation\" is the value of the duration of an experiment, which can be expressed in hours or as a number of RedOx cycles.",
    "voltage": "The definition of \"voltage\" is: \"The relation connects the frame-evoking element with the value of the voltage at which a cell was operated. Not to be confused with open_circuit_voltage (see Section 3.12).\"",
    "anode_material": "The \"anode_material\" relation is used to connect the frame-evoking element and the material that makes up the anode. As a convention, the fuel electrode is always annotated as an anode material, even in cases of electrolytic cells.",
    "thickness": "The definition of \"thickness\" is the physical dimension of a material, specifically the distance from one surface to the other, used to describe the composition of a cell component. For example, \"The cell stacks composed of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 porous electrolyte and La1\u2212xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.15, and 0.5) composite electrode were investigated by Werchmeister et al. [80].\"\n\nNote: The definition is not explicitly mentioned in the guideline, but based on the context and the example provided, it can be inferred that \"thickness\" refers to the physical dimension of a material used to describe the composition of a cell component.",
    "cathode_material": "The \"cathode_material\" is a relation that connects the frame-evoking element and the material that makes up the cathode. As a convention, it is always annotated as a cathode material (even in case of electrolytic cells). It also includes the ion conductive material in a composite cathode even if the electrolyte is made of the same material.",
    "electrolyte_material": "The \"electrolyte_material\" relation connects the frame-evoking element and the material that makes up the electrolyte.",
    "resistance": "Resistance is a relation that connects the frame-evoking element to the mention of the electrical resistance of a cell or cell component, usually expressed in area-specific units (\u2126 cm2).",
    "degradation_rate": "The degradation rate is the rate at which a cell's performance degrades over time, which can be expressed as a percentage.",
    "open_circuit_voltage": "The open_circuit_voltage (OCV) is the voltage of a fuel cell when it is not connected to a load, i.e., when there is no current flowing through it. This value is obtained from a device and is connected to the frame-evoking element.",
    "conductivity": "The definition of \"conductivity\" is: \"connects the frame-evoking element to the mention of the electrical conductivity of a certain cell or cell component. Electronic and ionic conductivities can be distinguished via the corresponding entries in the knowledge base.\"",
    "interlayer_material": "The \"interlayer_material\" relation connects the frame-evoking element with a material used as an interlayer or buffer layer in a SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell)."
