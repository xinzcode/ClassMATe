    "non-altering": "a word or a multi-word phrase that marks an action done on a sample that either does not induce any transformation of the sample or does not belong to any of the above classes. For example: \u201cThe pellets were placed in a sealed alumina crucible\u201d, \u201cthe reaction vessel was wrapped with aluminum foil\u201d, \u201cthe sample was sealed in a tube\u201d, \u201cthe gel was transferred to an oven\u201d.```",
    "starting": "a word or a multi-word phrase that marks the beginning of a synthesis procedure. Specifically, this often indicates which materials will be produced. For example: \u201cPMNPT was synthesized by the columbite precursor method\u201d, \u201csolid-state synthesis was used to prepare the target material\u201d, \u201cthe powder was obtained after the aforementioned procedure\u201d.```",
    "mixing": "a word or a multi-word phrase that marks the combination of different materials (in a solid or liquid phase) to form one substance or mass. For example: \u201cprecursors were weighted and ball-milled\u201d, \u201cprecursors were mixed in appropriate amounts\u201d, \u201cSb2O3 is added to the solution\u201d, \u201cthe solution was neutralized\u201d, \u201cthe mixture was stabilized by the addition of sodium citrate\u201d.```",
    "heating": "a word or a multi-word phrase that marks increasing or maintaining high temperature for the purpose of obtaining a specific sample phase or promoting a reaction rather than drying a sample. For example: \u201cthe powder sample was annealed to obtain a crystalline phase\u201d, \u201cthe mixture was subjected to heating at 240 C for 24 h\u201d.```",
    "reaction": "a word or a multi-word phrase that marks a transformation without any external action. For example: \u201cthe sample was le\ue09d to react for 6 h\u201d, \u201cthe temperature was kept at 1000 K\u201d, \u201cthe solution was maintained at 200 K for 12 h\u201d.```",
    "shaping": "a word or a multi-word phrase that marks the compression of powder or forming the sample to a specific shape. For example: \u201cthe powder was pressed into circular pellets\u201d, \u201cthe powder was then pelletized with a uniaxial press\u201d.```",
    "purification": "a word or a multi-word phrase that marks the separation of the sample phases. This also includes drying of a material. For example: \u201csamples were exfoliated from substrates\u201d, \u201cthe liquid was discarded and the remaining product was filtered off and washed several times with distilled water\u201d, \u201cthe precursors were heated in order to remove the moisture\u201d, \u201cthe precipitate was collected by washing the solution in distilled water\u201d.```",
    "cooling": "a word or a multi-word phrase that marks rapid, regular, or slow cooling of a sample. For example: \u201cthe product was cooled down to room temperature in the furnace\u201d, \u201cthe sample was quenched rapidly in the solid CO2\u201d, \u201cthe product was left to cool down to room temperature\u201d.```"
