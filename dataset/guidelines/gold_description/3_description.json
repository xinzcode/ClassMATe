{
    "element": "The Element category lists names and symbols of elements and compounds such as Ti, oxygen, and YBa2Cu3O7 or YBCO. This is strictly distinguishable from the Material category as entities in the Element category can be expressed by chemical composition formulae.```",
    "material": "The Material category lists the terms of structural entities and sample descriptors such as tetragonal crystal symmetry, bulk/film sample, and grain boundary. The information augments the details of the sample whose composition is defined by Element.```",
    "main": "The main categories in the SC-CoMIcs corpus are: Characterization, Process, Property, Material, Element, Doping, and Value, which are carefully designed to match the requirements from the domain experts and are used to annotate the abstracts related to superconductivity.```",
    "process": "The Process category lists the terms of Synthesis/Processing such as the sol-gel method for film samples, calcination for bulk samples, and AC/DC sputtering for thin-film preparation.```",
    "sc": "SC-CoMIcs stands for SuperConductivety Corpus for Materials Informatics, which is a novel corpus tailored for the text mining of superconducting materials in Materials Informatics (MI).",
    "characterization": "The characterization category lists the terms of characterization methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM).```",
    "property": "The Property category lists the terms of Property/Phenomena and their Theoretical representations such as electrical conductivity, mechanical hardness, electron-phonon coupling, and Fermi surface.```",
    "value": "The Value category targets numerical values with units, such as 160K. This enables to extract transition temperatures and process conditions, for example.```",
    "doping": "The Doping category lists terms of doping operations such as doping, substitute, and addition.```",
    "target": "The target refers to the superconducting materials or properties being described in the abstracts, which are the entities that the relation extraction task aims to identify and extract relationships with other entities mentioned in the abstracts.```",
    "equivalent": "The relation extraction label \"equivalent\" is not mentioned in the guideline. However, based on the content of the guideline, which focuses on text mining and named entity recognition in the field of Materials Science, I would define \"equivalent\" as a relation between two entities that have the same meaning or function, but may be represented differently in the text.\n\nFor example, \"Ti\" and \"titanium\" could be considered equivalent entities, as they refer to the same element. This definition would be useful in identifying synonyms or alternative names for materials, properties, or processes mentioned in the text.",
    "condition": "A condition refers to a specific set of circumstances or parameters under which a material's properties or behavior are observed or measured, such as temperature, pressure, or magnetic fields.```\n\nThis definition is inferred from the categories mentioned in the guideline, such as \"Property\" and \"Value\", which include terms related to materials' properties and quantitative information with units. The concept of condition is implied by the mention of \"process conditions\" in the Value category, which suggests that certain conditions are necessary to observe or measure specific properties.",
    "dopant": "According to the guideline, a \"doping\" operation is defined as \"doping, substitute, and addition\", which refers to the process of intentionally introducing impurities or additives into a material to alter its properties. This is mentioned in the \"Doping\" category, which lists terms related to doping operations.```",
    "event": "",
    "site": "A site refers to a specific location or area within a material, such as a grain boundary, bulk, film, or grain, which is used to describe the material's structure and properties.```"
