   This document describes our annotation guidelines for marking up scientific texts in the domain of materials science
   with information regarding experiments on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).      
                                                                                  
   We follow a frame-semantic approach (Fillmore et al., 2006) for annotating scientific publications with the relevant
   information. Anexperimentframecanbethoughtofasatemplatethathastobefilledwithrelevantinformation,e.g.,
   to fill a table with information about fuel cell experiments mentioned in a collection of papers. The relevant columns
   in such a table are for instance anode_material, cathode_material or fuel_used. (For a full list, see Section 3.) In
   frame semantics, a frame can be evoked by some word mentioning that an experiment was conducted. This word
   is also called the frame-evoking element. In Figure 1, the word demonstrated is the frame-evoking element as it
   signals to the reader that some experiment is being described in this sentence.

   The relevant categories related to an experiment frame (anode_material, fuel_used etc.) are called the partici-
   pants of the frame. As illustrated by Figure 1, on text, they are annotated as relations between the frame-evoking
   element and the span in the text mentioning the respective participant. Our annotation scheme contains several
   high-level (entity or concept) types for participant mentions, i.e., MATERIAL, VALUE or DEVICE. In addition, our
   annotation scheme features some additional link types that connect several experiment frame instances if they refer
   to the same or only slightly different experiment settings.                    
   Our annotation scheme is tailored to the domain of fuel cell experiments. However, superclassing the fuel cell
   experiment frame in future work will allow for more general experiment representations, which can then in turn be

   1 EXPERIMENT MENTIONS                                                          
                                                                                  
   As a first step, we identify sentences that describe a relevant solid oxide fuel cell experiment. Such sentences
   should explicitly mention at least one of the following elements:              
                                                                                  
   (cid:183) The material composition of the fuel cell                            
   (cid:183) The condition of operation of the fuel cell                          
                                                                                  
   (cid:183) The type of fuel cell                                                
   (cid:183) A chemico-physical property of the whole fuel cell                   
                                                                                  
   Among other things, we do not mark descriptions of processes, experiments unrelated to fuel cells, characterization
   techniques, synthesis procedures, explanations or evaluations. In this annotation pass, we do not mark material
   structure or any general material properties either.                           
   Usually, but not necessarily, an experiment is introduced to the text by a frame-evoking verb such as test, evaluate,
   measure, or generate. Depending on the context, the same verb may occur as frame-evoking element or not.
                                                                                  
   We annotate the words that introduce the experiments involving fuel cells with one of these labels:
   (cid:183) current_experiment: when original and novel content is introduced.   
                                                                                  
   (cid:183) previous_work: when the sentence focuses on specific previous work described in detail in other sources.
   (cid:183) general_info: whenthestateoftheartoffuelcellsisdescribed,e.g.,generalknowledgethatonecouldfindina
     textbook or in a survey.                                                     
                                                                                  
   (cid:183) future_work: when the authors suggest further research topics.       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   Examples                                                                       
                                                                                  
   Note: For the sake of clarity, the examples in these guidelines are only partially annotated. In each section, they
   display exclusively the frame participants and relations that are being discussed.

   This section describes the high-level entity or concept types that are used to mark the spans in the text referring
   to the participants of an experiment. In order to keep the amount of required annotation feasible, but also provide
                                                                                  
   training data for these types independent of the frame mentions, we decide to mark all mentions of instances of

   aloosedefinitionofneighbourhood, includingthe paragraphor,ifparagraph boundariesareunclear,the surrounding
   sentences. Annotators are asked to apply their own common sense to define the “relevant neighborhood” for a
   sentence.

   WeusethetypeMATERIALtoannotatetextspansreferringtomaterials,elementsorsubstancesthatarementioned

   may be specified by a particular material composition formula (e.g. La Sr Cr Mn O ) or, at the other end

   of the spectrum, just by a mention of the general class of materials such as oxides or hydrocarbons. If a cell
   component (e.g., an electrode) is composed of multiple materials, we annotate all of them, if possible as a single
   span. References to previous mentions of the material as in material, this, new anode etc. can also be annotated as
   spans of type MATERIAL. (In this case, if the mention is not informative on its own, a coreference link should be
   added as described in Section 4.2.) Adjectives relative to the material are included in the annotation only if they are
   necessary to distinguish between different materials that may have the same composition.

   3 EXPERIMENT PARTICIPANTS (RELATIONS)                                          
                                                                                  
   The relations explained in this section are used to indicate the participants of an experiment frame. In order to group
                                                                                  
   the various materials, values etc. into experiments, we connect them to the word in the text that indicates that an
   experiment was conducted, i.e., the frame-evoking element. All of these relations have their starting point at the
   frame-evoking element and their end point at the respective participant.       
   An experiment participant should always be connected to the closest frame-evoking element, which should be
   located in the same sentence and preferably in the same clause of the participant. If the information about the
   participants of an experiment is spread over multiple sentences, please connect the participant mention to the
   closest experiment-evoking verb and then group these verbs by connecting the frame-evoking elements with
   same_experiment.                                                               
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   3.1 anode_material                                                             
                                                                                  
   This relation is used to mark connections between the frame-evoking element and the material that makes up the
   anode.                                                                         
                                                                                  
   As a convention, we will always annotate the fuel electrode as anode material (even in case of electrolytic cells).
   We annotate as anode materials also the ion conductive material in a composite anode even if the electrolyte is
   made of the same material. For example, if there are two materials present in the anode, we annotate them both as

   The relations described in Section 3 all assume that the frame-evoking elements occurs in the same sentence as the
   participants of the frame. Very often, however, the description of an experiment is spread over several sentences.
   Annotators are then asked to link the frame participants to the closest frame-evoking element, which usually is in the
   same sentence. The relations explained here are used to connect several frame-evoking elements that describe the
                                                                                  
   exact same experiment or variations of the experimental settings explained above. While at times it may be difficult
   to differentiate them, we distinguish the following two cases:

     element indicating more experimental information on the same cell with the same experimental conditions. Some-
     times the frame-evoking elements of this kind have a meaning of further or deeper investigation or explanation,
     e.g. can be seen, exhibit etc.

   This section describes some questions that arise during annotation and our respective decisions.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   5.1 ...multiple parameter settings are described within one experiment frame?  
                                                                                  
   Sometimes, authors condense their text by reporting several experiments or experiment variations within the same
   sentence. Usually, this means that several parameter settings that were tested are being reported at the same time,
   asillustratedbytheexamplebelow. WhileitwouldbedesirabletoinducemultipleExperimentframeinstancesinthis
   case, it is difficult to annotate and also a challenge to any state-of-the-art machine learning system. From a use
                                                                                  
   case point of view, if a system is able to extract such a “series” of experiments correctly, recognizing the respective
   participants and their types correctly, this would already be very valuable. We hence leave the step of disentangling
   these multiple-experiment mentions to future work. Note that this means that we allow frame participants to occur
   multiple times in our frame instances.                                         
                                                                                  
   Examples

   5.2 ...it is unclear whether a verb is a frame-evoking element?                
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   Sometimes experimental mentions that should be marked are not clearly distinguishable from verbs that should be
   excluded from the annotation. The criterion that we use in this case is to mark exclusively mentions that can be
   immediately identified as complying to the indications in Section 1, without overthinking.
                                                                                  
   5.3 ...an experiment is described by more than one sentence?                   
                                                                                  
   Our annotation scheme is not tied to sentences. Hence, the participant mentions related to one frame-evoking
                                                                                  
   element may also occur in a neighboring (usually following) sentence. If there is a new frame-evoking element, we
   link the participant mentions to that as described in Section 4.1. If there is no new frame-evoking element, we simply
   link the participant mentions to the frame-evoking element in the previous sentence.
                                                                                  
   5.4 ...the participants of an experiments could be linked to different frame-evoking elements present in
      the same sentence?                                                          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   Whentherearemoreframe-evokingelementsinthesamesentence,theparticipantsshouldbelinkedtotheonethat
   is a main verb and it is situated in the same clause of the participants.      
                                                                                  
   5.5 ...two experiments are compared using only one verb?                       
                                                                                  
   When two or more experiments are compared, sometimes a sentence with only one frame-evoking element is used.
                                                                                  
   In this case, we mark all the participants, even if they are mutually exclusive. Similarly as in Section 5.1, we leave
   the disentangling to future work.

   a fuel cell is composed of two electrodes and an electrolyte that separates them. In a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC),
                                                                                  
   the electrolyte is in the solid state and is made of various ceramic materials containing oxygen, the oxides. At the
   cathode of an SOFC, oxygen molecules are adsorbed, split and reduced (they gain electrons) (6.2). Then, they
   migratetotheanodethroughtheelectrolyte(6.4). Attheanodethefuelisadsorbed,split,oxidized(itloseselectrons)
   and it combines with the oxygen ions coming from the electrolyte (6.3). In order to allow the reaction and the motion
   of charge carriers, the operating temperature must be high enough. Within a stack, many fuel cells are connected
   through an interconnecting material (6.5). The advantage of the SOFCs is a very high energy efficiency, their
   disadvantages are caused by the high operating temperature (6.12) and include long start-up times, degradation,
   high material costs.                                                           
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   6.2 Cathode                                                                    
                                                                                  
   In an SOFC, the cathode is the oxygen electrode, where oxygen molecules are adsorbed, split and reduced (they
   gain electrons). After this, they migrate to the electrolyte. The cathode should therefore exhibit a catalytic effect,
   reducing the activation energy of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In addition to this, it should be electronically
   conductive and porous, to allow the gaseous oxygen to arrive at the reaction site. Ideally, it should also be ionically
   conductive,enablingthemigrationofoxygenionstheelectrolyte,inwhichcasethematerialisamixedionicelectronic
   conductor (MIEC). Otherwise, the oxygen reduction reaction can only happen at the triple phase boundary (TPB),
   i.e. the interface between the cathode material, which is electronically conductive, the electrolyte, which is ionically
   conductive, and a pore, which allows the flow of the oxygen gas.               
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   6.3 Anode                                                                      
                                                                                  
   In an SOFC, the anode is the fuel electrode, where fuel molecules are adsorbed, split and oxidized (they lose
   electrons). Then they combine with the oxygen coming from the cathode via the electrolyte and form a byproduct.
   The anode must be electronically and ionically conductive, porous and act as a catalyst. Moreover, it should be
   resistant to deactivation that could be caused by unwanted adsorption of gas atoms on the surface.

   The interconnect connects the cells belonging to the same stack. It is electron conductive and it can be a ceramic
   material or a metal. In the latter case, the diffusion of chromium from the interconnect to other cell components is a
   common issue. The interconnect should be stable at high temperature both in reducing and oxidizing atmosphere.

   The fuel of an SOFC is the educt at the anode side and can either be pure hydrogen or a carbon based fuel, such as
   hydrocarbons or carbon monoxide. The byproduct is water in the first case, mostly carbon dioxide in the second.
   Even if an SOFC is fueled with hydrocarbons, its environmental impact is lower than conventional combustion
   engines, because its efficiency is higher. However, hydrocarbons fuel may cause deposition of carbon on the anode,
   leading to lower power output.

   The support material provides mechanical support to the cell. An SOFC can be anode, cathode, electrolyte or metal
   supported. The support should be stable at high temperatures and, if possible, cheap.

   This properties indicates how much power per unit of area is generated in a fuel cell. It is measured in Wcm−2
   and depends on the temperature, the materials and the fuel used. It is a key quantity for the evaluation of the cell
   performance.                                                                   
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   6.10 Electrical Resistance                                                     
                                                                                  
   The total electrical resistance per unit area of an SOFC has two components: ohmic resistance and polarization
   resistance. In common SOFCs materials, they both increase when temperature decreases.
   The ohmic resistance indicates how difficult it is to move charge carriers inside a material. It corresponds to the
                                                                                  
   inverse of the conductivity multiplied by the material thickness.              
   The polarization resistance is an electric property of an interface between two materials and is measured in Ωcm2.
   It is related to the oxygen reduction reaction rate (the electrocatalytic activity) and the oxygen conductivity inside
   a material. A high polarization resistance means that the oxygen reduction reaction happens slowly and oxygen
   vacancies cannot easily diffuse and cross the interface. Therefore charge accumulates at the electrode surface,
   polarizing it.                                                                 
   The terms Area Specific Resistance (ASR) and Polarization Resistance are often used interchangeably.

   6.11 Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)                                                
                                                                                  
   The open circuit voltages corresponds to the voltage generated by the redox reaction, which can be measured in a
   cell without any electrical current flow. In the ideal case, its value should approach the theoretical one derived by the
   Nernst equation, but is commonly lower due to losses. The OCV typically decreases with increasing temperature.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
   6.12 Operating Temperature                                                     
                                                                                  
   There are different types of SOFCs that typically work at different temperatures: Intermediate-temperature SOFCs
   usually operate between 650 and 800°C and high-temperature SOFCs between 800°C and 1000°C .
                                                                                  
   While it is generally desirable to decrease operating temperatures due to long start-up times and stability issues
   of the materials, the conductivity of the cell components and the reaction rates typically decrease with increasing
   temperature. Designing high performance SOFCs that work at intermediate temperatures is therefore a field of
   ongoing research.
